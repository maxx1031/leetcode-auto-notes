# 2824. Count Pairs Whose Sum is Less than Target

## 1. Clarifying Questions

When approaching this problem, consider clarifying the following points:

Q: **What is the range of the numbers in the input list?**
   → Typical Answer: The numbers can be any integers within the range of -10^9 to 10^9.

Q: **Can the input list be empty or contain only one element?**
   → Typical Answer: Yes, the input list can be empty or contain only one element, in which case the output should be 0.

Q: **Are there duplicate numbers in the input list, and should they be considered in forming pairs?**
   → Typical Answer: Yes, duplicates can exist, and each instance should be considered when forming pairs.

## 2. Algorithm & Data Structure

To solve this problem, several algorithmic approaches can be considered:

- **Main Algorithm Category**: Two Pointers, Sorting, Brute Force
- **Approach 1**: Two Pointers with Sorting
- **Approach 2**: Brute Force
- **Approach 3**: Binary Search (not detailed here but possible)
- **Data Structure**: List, Pointers

## 3. High-Level Description

### Approach 1: Two Pointers with Sorting
- **Core Idea**: Sort the list and use two pointers, one at the start and one at the end, to efficiently count pairs.
- **Execution**: If the sum of the elements at the two pointers is less than the target, count all pairs between the current left pointer and the right pointer, then move the left pointer to the right. If not, move the right pointer to the left.

### Approach 2: Brute Force
- **Core Idea**: Check all possible pairs in the list and count those whose sum is less than the target.
- **Execution**: Use two nested loops to iterate over all pairs and increment the count when the sum is less than the target.

## 4. Code (with Key Explanations)

```python
class Solution:
    def countPairs(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        """
        Approach 1: Two Pointers with Sorting
        - Sort the array.
        - Use two pointers to find and count pairs whose sum is less than the target.
        """
        nums.sort()
        j = len(nums) - 1
        i = 0
        count = 0
        while i < j:
            if (nums[i] + nums[j]) < target:
                count += (j - i)
                i += 1
            else:
                j -= 1
        return count
```

```python
def countPairsBruteForce(nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
    """
    Approach 2: Brute Force
    - Iterate over all possible pairs and count those whose sum is less than the target.
    """
    count = 0
    n = len(nums)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if nums[i] + nums[j] < target:
                count += 1
    return count
```

| Brute Force            | O(n^2)          | O(1)             |

## 7. Follow-Up & Optimizations

1. **Handling Streaming Data**: How could the algorithm be adapted to handle a stream of data where pairs need to be counted in real-time?
2. **Optimizing Space Complexity**: Can we further optimize space usage, especially if the input list is very large?
3. **Parallel Processing**: How might this problem be solved using parallel processing to handle very large datasets efficiently?
