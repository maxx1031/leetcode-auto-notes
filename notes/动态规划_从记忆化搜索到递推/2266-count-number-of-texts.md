# 2266. Count Number of Texts

## 1. Clarifying Questions
What boundary conditions or constraints should I confirm with an interviewer before coding? (Provide at least 3 valuable questions with typical answers).

Q: What is the maximum length of the `pressedKeys` string?  
→ Typical Answer: The length can go up to \(10^5\), as stated in the problem constraints.  

Q: Are there any specific characters in `pressedKeys` that should be treated differently?  
→ Typical Answer: Yes, the keys '7' and '9' allow up to 4 consecutive presses, while other keys allow up to 3 consecutive presses.  

Q: Should I account for cases with invalid key inputs (e.g., non-digit characters)?  
→ Typical Answer: No, the input will always consist of valid numeric keys from '2' to '9'.

**Main Algorithm Category:** Dynamic Programming  
- **Approach 1:** Precomputed Dynamic Programming Arrays  
- **Approach 2:** Sliding Window with Dynamic Programming

## 3. High-Level Description
Briefly describe the execution flow for each major approach. Use "Approach X: [Approach Name]" as a title.

### Approach 1: Precomputed Dynamic Programming Arrays  
- Precompute arrays `f` and `g` for up to \(10^5\) consecutive presses.  
- Use the precomputed values to calculate the number of ways to interpret each group of identical key presses.  
- Iterate through the grouped characters in `pressedKeys` and multiply results for each group to get the final answer.  

### Approach 2: Sliding Window with Dynamic Programming  
- Use a sliding window approach to dynamically calculate the number of ways to interpret consecutive presses.  
- Maintain a rolling DP array of size 4 (for keys '7' and '9') or size 3 (for other keys).  
- Iterate through the string while updating the DP array based on the current character.  

### Approach 3: Recursive Backtracking with Memoization  
- Use recursion to explore all possible interpretations of the `pressedKeys` string.  
- Memoize results for overlapping subproblems to reduce redundant computations.  
- Base cases handle single presses, while recursive cases explore valid groupings based on the current key.

## 4. Code (with Key Explanations)

### My Code: Precomputed Dynamic Programming Arrays
```python
MOD = 1_000_000_007
f = [1, 1, 2, 4]  # Precompute for keys allowing up to 3 presses
g = [1, 1, 2, 4]  # Precompute for keys allowing up to 4 presses
for _ in range(10 ** 5 - 3):  # Extend precomputed arrays to max length
    f.append((f[-1] + f[-2] + f[-3]) % MOD)
    g.append((g[-1] + g[-2] + g[-3] + g[-4]) % MOD)

class Solution:
    def countTexts(self, pressedKeys: str) -> int:
        """
        Count the number of ways to interpret the `pressedKeys` string using precomputed DP arrays.
        """
        ans = 1
        for ch, s in groupby(pressedKeys):  # Group consecutive identical characters
            l = len(list(s))  # Length of the group
            ans *= (g[l] if ch in "79" else f[l])  # Use appropriate DP array
            ans %= MOD  # Ensure result stays within bounds
        return ans
```

### Approach 2: Sliding Window with Dynamic Programming
```python
class Solution:
    def countTexts(self, pressedKeys: str) -> int:
        """
        Sliding window approach to dynamically calculate the number of ways to interpret `pressedKeys`.
        """
        MOD = 1_000_000_007
        n = len(pressedKeys)
        dp = [0] * n
        dp[0] = 1

        for i in range(1, n):
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1]
            if i > 1 and pressedKeys[i] == pressedKeys[i - 1]:
                dp[i] += dp[i - 2]
            if i > 2 and pressedKeys[i] == pressedKeys[i - 1] == pressedKeys[i - 2]:
                dp[i] += dp[i - 3]
            if pressedKeys[i] in "79" and i > 3 and pressedKeys[i] == pressedKeys[i - 1] == pressedKeys[i - 2] == pressedKeys[i - 3]:
                dp[i] += dp[i - 4]
            dp[i] %= MOD

        return dp[-1]
```

### Approach 3: Recursive Backtracking with Memoization
```python
class Solution:
    def countTexts(self, pressedKeys: str) -> int:
        """
        Recursive backtracking with memoization to count the number of ways to interpret `pressedKeys`.
        """
        MOD = 1_000_000_007
        memo = {}

        def dfs(i):
            if i == len(pressedKeys):
                return 1
            if i in memo:
                return memo[i]

            count = 0
            limit = 4 if pressedKeys[i] in "79" else 3
            for j in range(i, min(i + limit, len(pressedKeys))):
                if pressedKeys[j] == pressedKeys[i]:
                    count += dfs(j + 1)
                else:
                    break
            memo[i] = count % MOD
            return memo[i]

        return dfs(0)
```

| Mixed keys            | `"222777"`        | `16`   | Combines interpretations for '222' and '777'.                              |
| Edge case (max length) | `"2" * 100000`    | `...`  | Handles large input efficiently using precomputed DP arrays.               |
| Special keys '7'/'9'  | `"7777"`          | `8`    | Can be interpreted as `[7, 77, 777, 7777]`.                                |

## 7. Follow-Up & Optimizations
1. **Streaming Data:** How would the algorithm handle streaming data, where `pressedKeys` is received in chunks?  
   → Consider a sliding window approach or incremental DP updates.  

2. **Generalization:** Can the algorithm be generalized to handle non-numeric keys or arbitrary grouping rules?  
   → Extend precomputation logic and groupby handling for custom key mappings.  

3. **Extreme Optimization:** Is it possible to reduce space complexity further for recursive approaches?  
   → Use iterative DP with constant space or optimize memoization with fewer stored states.
